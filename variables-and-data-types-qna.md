# JavaScript Basics Q&A

## Variables and Data Types:

1. **Question:** What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript?

   - **Answer:** I will first consider what I will be using the variable for (i.e., whether it may change in the future or not). If it will never change, I will use `const`. If it will change, I will use either `var` or `let` (I prefer `let` in most cases because it is block-scoped, while `var` is function-scoped and also prevents variable hoisting and unintentional redeclaration of variables). I would type the name of the variable (e.g., `greet`) and use the assignment operator (`=`) to initialize the value. Example: `let greet = "Hello"` or `const greet = "Hello"`.
